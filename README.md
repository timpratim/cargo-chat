# Cargo Chat ü¶Äüí¨

**AI-powered code search and Q&A for your repositories**

Cargo Chat helps you understand and navigate codebases using natural language. Ask questions about your code and get intelligent answers backed by semantic search and AI analysis.

## ‚ú® What Can You Do?

- **Ask questions about your codebase** in plain English
- **Search across multiple programming languages** (Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Python, and more)
- **Get context-aware answers** that understand your specific code
- **Interactive chat mode** for exploring codebases efficiently
- **Smart code retrieval** that finds relevant code snippets automatically

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **OpenAI API Key** (set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable)
  - Get one at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- That's it! Embedding models download automatically on first use.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd cargo-chat

# Build the application
cargo build --release

# Optional: Enable command history (saves your commands)
cargo build --release --features with-file-history
```

## üí° How to Use

### Step 1: Start Interactive Mode

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Start cargo-chat
./target/release/cargo_chat interactive
```

### Step 2: Index Your Codebase

```bash
# Inside cargo-chat, index your project
index --repo /path/to/your/project --out ./my_project_index
```

### Step 3: Ask Questions!

```bash
# Ask about your code
query "How does authentication work in this codebase?"
query "Show me examples of error handling"
query "What are the main API endpoints?"
```

### Available Commands

- `index --repo <path> --out <index_dir>` - Index a codebase
- `load_index <index_dir>` - Load an existing index
- `query "<question>"` - Ask questions about your code
- `status` - Show current model and index info
- `help` - Show all commands
- `exit` - Quit cargo-chat

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- Make sure you've set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits

**"Model download failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space for embedding models

**"No results found"**
- Try rephrasing your question
- Make sure your codebase was indexed successfully
- Check if your question matches the programming language in your codebase

### Enable Debug Logging

For troubleshooting, you can enable detailed logging:

```bash
# Show debug information
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/cargo_chat interactive
```
